# WebSQL
Implemented a webpage using HTML5 technique and WebSQL

Created a webpage pdf.png.

The inputs of the form supports HTML5 verification to make sure that the data entered by the users is correct.

If the data entered by the user is correct, i used Web SQL technique to save the data into a database when the users press the "SAVE" button.

But no need to create server code to process the form.

I used the INSERT operation to "SAVE" data.

After the INSERT operation,  use READ operation to read the inserted data and then use alert() to display the data.

WEBSQL EXAMPLE

Created this webpage:

+--------------------------------+
|         +----------------+     |
| Color:  |                |     |
|         +----------------+     |
|         +----------------+     |
| Number: |                |     |
|         +----------------+     |
|           +------------+       |
|           |    Save    |       |
|           +------------+       |
+--------------------------------+
    
The inputs of the form support the following HTML5 verification to make sure that the data entered by the users is correct.

The "Color" field is implemented using the input type "color".

The "Number" field is using the input type "number" and can only contain numbers between 0 and 130.

If the data entered by the user is correct, i used Web SQL technique to save the data into a database when the users press the "SAVE" button.

But no need to create server code to process the form.

I used the INSERT operation to "SAVE" data.

After the INSERT operation,  use READ operation to read the inserted data and then use alert() to display the data.
